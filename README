Purpose: 
	Sending SMS via Najdi.si Free SMS

Description: 
	Script logs in using your username and password for https://id.najdi.si and then it sends an SMS to a mobile phone number. 
	There is a 160 character limit per message and daily limit of 40 sent messages.
	The script tries to limit the number of requests to a page and tries to hold on to the session as long as possible. 
	The session cookie is stored in a /tmp/folder for later use, if the script restarts. 
	Once instantiated, object can be reused for sending a number of SMS messages. 
	If a new object is instantiated, it will prefer to use a stored session.


Example usage:

<?php
$sms = new sms();
$sms->send('090666666','one does not simply send an SMS');
?>
